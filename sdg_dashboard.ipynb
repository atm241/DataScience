      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    World Bank databases are multi-dimensional databases that at a minimum\n",
      "    have series, economy, and time dimensions. Concept names are not consistent\n",
      "    across databases, but the wbgapi module tries to insulate the user from\n",
      "    these inconsistencies. Use the concepts() function to access the low-level\n",
      "    concept names.\n",

      "FUNCTIONS\n",
      "    Series(id='all', q=None, name='SourceName')\n",
